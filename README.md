# OPNsense Virtual Firewall Lab

This repository documents a hands-on firewall lab project built using **OPNsense** in a virtualized environment. The lab simulates real-world small office setups and focuses on understanding core firewall functions, network segmentation, access control, and service configuration.

## 🔧 What I Did

- Set up a virtual lab using **VirtualBox**
- Installed and configured **OPNsense Firewall**
- Assigned **LAN (static IP)** and **WAN (DHCP)** interfaces
- Accessed and managed firewall using **Web GUI and CLI**
- Configured and tested:
  - **Firewall rules** for user-level access control
  - **DHCP and DNS** services for internal network
  - **Captive portal** to restrict guest internet usage
  - **Interface aliasing** in preparation for VLAN segmentation

## 📸 Screenshots

Uploaded key images demonstrating:
- System console access
- Web login and dashboard
- Basic network configuration
- Interface status and monitoring

## 🎯 Objective

To gain real-world experience in:
- Setting up a secure network using a free, open-source firewall
- Practicing firewall rule implementation and user control
- Understanding segmentation using interfaces and aliases
- Learning how small office networks are designed and secured

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a dedicated IT graduate currently working as a **Desktop Support Engineer Intern**, actively building skills in system administration, firewall configuration, and network infrastructure.
