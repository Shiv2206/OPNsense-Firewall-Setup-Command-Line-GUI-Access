# OPNsense Virtual Firewall Lab

This repository documents a hands-on firewall lab project built using **OPNsense** in a virtualized environment. The lab simulates real-world small office setups and focuses on understanding core firewall functions, network segmentation, access control, and service configuration.

## ðŸ”§ What I Did

- Set up a virtual lab using **VirtualBox**
- Installed and configured **OPNsense Firewall**
- Assigned **LAN (static IP)** and **WAN (DHCP)** interfaces
- Accessed and managed firewall using **Web GUI and CLI**
- Configured and tested:
  - **Firewall rules** for user-level access control
  - **DHCP and DNS** services for internal network
  - **Captive portal** to restrict guest internet usage
  - **Interface aliasing** in preparation for VLAN segmentation
